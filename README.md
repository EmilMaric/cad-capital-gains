## Overview
Calculating your capital gains and tracking your adjusted cost base (ACB) manually, or using an Excel document, often proves to be a laborious process. This CLI tool calculates your capital gains and ACB for you, and just requires a transaction file (CSV or JSON) with basic information about your transactions. The idea with this tool is that you are able to more or less cut-and-copy the output that it generates and copy it into whatever tax filing software you end up using.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This tool only supports full superficial capital losses, and does not support partial superficial losses. Please ensure you understand this limitation before using the tool for tax purposes.

## Features
- Calculate capital gains for stocks traded in both CAD and USD
- Track adjusted cost base (ACB) across multiple years
- Support for both CSV and JSON input formats
- Handle superficial loss rules automatically
- Calculate maximum cost for T1135 reporting
- Support for both table and JSON output formats
- Alert you if your holdings exceed the T1135 reporting threshold
- Break down the maximum cost by ticker for detailed reporting
- Support transactions with multiple different stock tickers in the same file
- Automatically fetch daily exchange rates from the Bank of Canada for USD transactions
- Apply [superficial capital loss](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-127-capital-gains/capital-losses-deductions/what-a-superficial-loss.html) rules when calculating gains and ACB
  - Only supports full superficial capital losses (not partial)
  - Losses are carried forward as prescribed by the CRA
  - A sale with a capital loss will be treated as superficial if:
    - Shares with the same ticker were bought in the 61 day window (30 days before or 30 days after the sale)
    - There is a non-zero balance of shares sharing the same ticker at the end of the 61 day window
- Support fractional quantities of shares

## Commission Handling and Calculations
### Commission Handling
- Buy transactions: Commissions are added to the adjusted cost base (ACB)
- Sell transactions: Commissions are subtracted from proceeds
- Currency conversion: For USD transactions, commissions are converted to CAD using the same exchange rate as the transaction
- Commissions are always included in the cost base calculation for tax purposes

### Calculation Methodology
The tool follows these steps when calculating capital gains:

1. For buy transactions:
   - Convert the share price to CAD if in USD
   - Convert the commission to CAD if in USD
   - Calculate total cost: (quantity × price × exchange_rate) + (commission × exchange_rate)
   - Add to the adjusted cost base (ACB)

2. For sell transactions:
   - Convert the share price to CAD if in USD
   - Convert the commission to CAD if in USD
   - Calculate proceeds: (quantity × price × exchange_rate)
   - Subtract commission: proceeds - (commission × exchange_rate)
   - Calculate capital gain/loss: proceeds - commission - ACB

3. Special considerations:
   - All calculations maintain precision to avoid rounding errors
   - Exchange rates are fetched from the Bank of Canada for the specific transaction date
   - In superficial loss scenarios, commissions are still included in the original calculations before the loss is denied

#### Examples
1. Buy transaction in USD:
```
Buy 100 shares at $50.00 USD with $9.99 USD commission
Exchange rate: 2.0 CAD/USD
ACB = (100 × $50.00 × 2.0) + ($9.99 × 2.0)
    = $10,000.00 + $19.98
    = $10,019.98 CAD
```

2. Sell transaction in USD:
```
Sell 50 shares at $55.00 USD with $9.99 USD commission
Exchange rate: 2.0 CAD/USD
Proceeds = (50 × $55.00 × 2.0) - ($9.99 × 2.0)
        = $5,500.00 - $19.98
        = $5,480.02 CAD
```

3. Mixed currency example:
```
Buy 100 shares at $25.00 CAD with $9.99 CAD commission
ACB = (100 × $25.00) + $9.99
    = $2,500.00 + $9.99
    = $2,509.99 CAD
```

### Important Notes
- The tool uses the Bank of Canada's noon rates (pre-2017) and indicative rates (post-2017) for currency conversion
- Maximum cost is calculated based on the adjusted cost base (ACB) of your holdings
- The tool considers both buying and selling activities throughout the year
- If your maximum cost exceeds CAD $100,000, ensure you file form T1135 with your tax return to avoid penalties

## T1135 Foreign Income Verification Statement
The T1135 form is a requirement from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for Canadian residents who own specified foreign property with a total cost of more than CAD $100,000 at any time during the tax year. This includes foreign securities held in Canadian brokerage accounts.

### When is T1135 Required?
You must file a T1135 if:
- You are a Canadian resident for tax purposes
- You owned specified foreign property (including foreign stocks) with a total cost exceeding CAD $100,000 at any time during the year
- The securities are held for investment purposes (not personal use)

### How This Tool Helps with T1135
This tool provides the `maxcost` command to help with T1135 reporting. To calculate the maximum cost of your foreign securities for T1135 reporting:

```bash
$ capgains maxcost tests/sample.csv 2023
```
or
```bash
$ capgains maxcost tests/sample.json 2023
```


This command will:
- Calculate the maximum cost of your foreign securities during the tax year
- Show the maximum cost in CAD using official Bank of Canada exchange rates
- Break down the costs by individual security
- Alert you if you exceed the T1135 reporting threshold

# Input File Requirements
The tool supports both CSV and JSON input formats for transaction data.

## CSV Format
Create a CSV file with each line representing a `BUY` or `SELL` transaction. Transactions **must be in chronological order**. The format is:
```csv
<yyyy-mm-dd>,<description>,<stock_ticker>,<action(BUY/SELL)>,<quantity>,<price>,<commission>,<currency>
```

Example:
```csv
2017-2-15,ESPP PURCHASE,GOOG,BUY,100,50.00,10.00,USD
2017-5-20,RSU VEST,GOOG,SELL,50,45.00,0.00,CAD
```

## JSON Format
Create a JSON file containing an array of transaction objects. Transactions **must be in chronological order**. The format is:
```json
[
  {
    "date": "2017-02-15",
    "description": "ESPP PURCHASE",
    "ticker": "GOOG",
    "action": "BUY",
    "qty": 100,
    "price": 50.00,
    "commission": 10.00,
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  {
    "date": "2017-05-20",
    "description": "RSU VEST",
    "ticker": "GOOG",
    "action": "SELL",
    "qty": 50,
    "price": 45.00,
    "commission": 0.00,
    "currency": "CAD"
  }
]
```

**NOTE: This tool only supports calculating ACB and capital gains with transactions
dating from May 1, 2007 and onwards.**

# Usage
To show the transaction file in a nice tabular format you can run:
```bash
$ capgains show tests/sample.csv
+------------+--------------------+----------+----------+-------+----------+--------------+------------+
| date       | description        | ticker   | action   |   qty |    price |   commission |   currency |
|------------+--------------------+----------+----------+-------+----------+--------------+------------|
| 2022-01-15 | Initial Purchase   | AAPL     | BUY      |   100 |   142.50 |         9.99 |        USD |
| 2022-02-10 | Buy Canadian Bank  | TD.TO    | BUY      |   150 |    78.25 |         9.99 |        CAD |
| 2022-03-20 | Buy Tech           | GOOGL    | BUY      |    20 | 2,200.00 |         9.99 |        USD |
...
```

You can also output the results in JSON format:
```bash
$ capgains show tests/sample.csv --format json
{
  "transactions": [
    {
      "date": "2022-01-15",
      "description": "Initial Purchase",
      "ticker": "AAPL",
      "action": "BUY",
      "quantity": 100,
      "price": 142.50,
      "commission": 9.99,
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
